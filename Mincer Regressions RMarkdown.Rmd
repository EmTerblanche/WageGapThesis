## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

GHS2018New <- read.csv(file = "~/Desktop/Masters/Thesis Datawork/GHS2018LimitedVariablesEduc.csv", header = TRUE) 

GHS2002New <- read.csv(file = "~/Desktop/Masters/Thesis Datawork/GHS2002LimitedVarsEduc.csv", header = TRUE)

append_GHSNew <- bind_rows(GHS2018New,GHS2002New)

append_GHSNew <- mutate(append_GHSNew, educnum = recode(education,

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Mincer Regression 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(flextable)
library(huxtable)
GHSMincerNew <- lm(logsal ~ educnum + age + age2 + Sex + Race + lastyear + lastyear*Race, data=append_GHSNew)
tab <- huxreg(GHSMincerNew)
flextable(tab)

```
